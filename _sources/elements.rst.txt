Cordinates of elements
----------------------
- cordinates are placed in tuple values in sets of two
- Each tuple represents an X and Y value
- First X and Y cordinate represents the top left corner of a specific element
- Second X and Y cordinate represents the bottom right corner of a specific element

Screen Setup
------------
- These cordinates were recorded using a 1920x1080 screen
- Using a maximized chrome browser ('Windows' + 'up' keys produces the desired screen size for the browser)

elements
--------
the `elements` variable holds the cordinates of elements on a standard maxamized browser screen with 1920x1080 resolution

inspect_elements
----------------
the `inspect_elements` variable holds the cordinates of elements on a screen similar to `elements` but has the chrome dev-tools panel opened.

These values might have to change depending on the width of the dev-tools panel.
